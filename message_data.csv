message,no_replies,U01T2RB3BRC,U024QQGAX7B,"Morning, guys. I just shared a Google doc with a visual on how we would like the document analysis to look. It is basic at the moment and there would be things to add. From talking with potential customers, they might be interested as a first step only in the document analysis. So that is why I have added the option of having 2 pathways once a manager/owner logs in.
If they want to test people, they will need to upgrade. That is the thinking behind it for now anyway.

We will review at 2. See you then <!channel>",2021-07-14 09:12:39.002799988,2021-07-14
